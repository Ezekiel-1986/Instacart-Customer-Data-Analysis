# Instacart-Customer-Data-Analysis
Although having very good sales, Instarcart wants to use its customer data to uncover more information about their sales patterns. They want to answer questions around busiest days of the week, hours of the day, customer loyalty with respect to price ranges etc. Analysis has been conducted using Jupyter notebooks and the Anaconda libraries manager. Analysis has been conducted using Python and relevant libraries (pandas, NumPy, os, matplotlib, scipy, and seaborn). All required libraries have been successfully installed and imported into each script.
